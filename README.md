# counsel

the end of boilerplate. bake structure, opinions, and rules into projects.

it's kind of like [yeoman/yo](http://yeoman.io/), but as a source controlled dependency that brings shared behaviors to all of your packages, beyond just project structure.

`counsel` is for **project maintainers**.  counsel makes sense for people who are developing _many_ projects.  counsel doesn't always make sense for teams or maintainers working on just a single project or two.
